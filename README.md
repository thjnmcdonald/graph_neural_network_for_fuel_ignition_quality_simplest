# Graph neural networks for ignition quality prediction

small test to see if git push and pull works

This is the source code for the paper **Graph Neural Networks for Prediction of Fuel Ignition Quality** (**[https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c01533](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c01533)**). 

You can also run the code via our free web frontend avaibale here: [https://www.avt.rwth-aachen.de/gnn](https://www.avt.rwth-aachen.de/gnn)

## Required packages

The code is built upon: 

* **[PyTorch Geometric package](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric)**
* **[k-GNN package](https://github.com/chrsmrrs/k-gnn)**
* **[RDKit package](https://www.rdkit.org/)**

which need to be installed before using our code.

Please follow their **installation instructions**: **[PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)**, **[k-GNN](https://github.com/chrsmrrs/k-gnn)**, **[RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)**.

## Usage

This repository contains following folders:
